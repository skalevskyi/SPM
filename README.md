## 📌 About

SPM is a mobile outdoor advertising platform designed for local B2B businesses.

- 🚗 One vehicle (Nissan Qashqai)
- 📍 Fixed daily route (Montpellier → Littoral)
- 🎯 Local audience targeting
- 📊 Predictable visibility model (corridor-based, i18n)

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🧮 Dynamic pricing calculator (engine + UI separation)
- 📐 Corridor-based visibility model (i18n-driven)
- 📩 Lead capture (`POST /api/lead`, Resend, optional Upstash backup)
- 📱 Responsive, mobile-first UI (bottom nav, safe areas)
- 🌍 Multi-language support (FR / EN / UA)
- ✨ Motion with Framer Motion (reduced-motion aware)
- 🚀 Production deployment on Vercel

---

## 💰 Pricing & visibility model

- 💸 Pricing lives in the calculator engine (`config.ts`, `rules.ts`, `engine.ts`)
- 👁 User-facing visibility uses **corridor ranges** per format (i18n), not raw engine contact constants
- ⚠️ Internal engine constants are not treated as product truth in messaging
- 📉 CPM in the UI is a **static, corridor-aligned** explanatory line (e.g. ≈ 4 € / 1000 contacts), not dynamically computed from engine contacts

---

## 🧱 Tech stack

- ⚡ Next.js 15 (App Router)
- ⚛️ React 19
- 📘 TypeScript
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS
- 🎬 Framer Motion
- ☁️ Vercel
- ✉️ Resend
- 🗄 Upstash Redis (lead backup, production)

---

## 🏗 Architecture

- 🧠 **Engine** — calculation logic (`src/lib/calculator/`)
- ⚙️ **Config** — pricing and technical constants (`config.ts`)
- 🖥 **UI** — presentation (`OfferCalculatorPanel`, sections, i18n)

Key principle: strict separation between pricing logic and UI; visibility copy follows the corridor + i18n product rule (see `/SPEC/CALCULATOR_CURRENT_STATE.md`).

## 🚀 Deployment

Hosted on **Vercel**. Lead submission uses **`/api/lead`** (Node serverless runtime).

**Required / common environment variables** (see `.env.example`):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=
RESEND_API_KEY=
LEAD_TO_EMAIL=
```

Optional: `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`, Upstash `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_*`, `LEAD_BACKUP_LIST_KEY`, rate limits, `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` for subpath deploys.

**Local development**

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Production build**

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## 📊 Status

- ✅ Core landing, calculator, and lead pipeline implemented
- 🎯 Ongoing UI/UX and copy polish
- ⏳ Roadmap: FAQ, coverage map, media kit
