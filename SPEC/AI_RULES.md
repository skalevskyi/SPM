# AI Rules — ADMOVE Project

Rules for AI-assisted development in Cursor and other tools.

## Mandatory References

1. **Always check core SPEC files before coding.** Read `/SPEC/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `/SPEC/ROADMAP.md`, and when relevant `/SPEC/PRODUCT/website_spec.md`, `/SPEC/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, `/SPEC/UI_IMPLEMENTATION_STRATEGY.md` before generating or modifying code.
2. **Respect the architecture** defined in `/SPEC/PRODUCT/website_spec.md` for all front-end and page structure.
3. **Do not invent features** outside the roadmap. Check `/SPEC/ROADMAP.md` for scope.
4. **Follow the product logic** defined in `/SPEC/PRODUCT/product_spec.md` for wording, formats, and value proposition.
5. **Keep implementation consistent** with:
   - `/SPEC/PRODUCT/pricing_model.md` for pricing estimation concept and future calculator (no fixed prices in UI in Phase 2A).
   - `/SPEC/PRODUCT/visibility_model.md` for visibility figures and methodology (indicative placeholders).

## UI-Only Phase (Current)

- **Current phase is UI-only.** Do not implement business logic, backend, API, or form submission. No fetch, no axios, no server actions, no API routes. No real calculator/estimation logic, no interactive map logic, no media kit download logic.
- **Landing structure is fixed:** Navbar → Hero → **Le support publicitaire / How the advertising works** (section id `#support`) → Parcours → Offres → Contact → Footer. Do **not** reintroduce separate top-level sections such as Problem, Solution, Vehicle, Pricing, Coverage Map, Price Simulator, FAQ, or Media Kit unless the SPEC is explicitly updated. Visibility content lives inside Parcours; pricing is not shown in the Offres UI in Phase 2A.
- **Offres section:** Displays three packages with real mockups. Do **not** display fixed price labels or a static pricing table in Offres during the current phase. The calculator is a **placeholder only** (expandable shell, static fields, CTA to #contact); real calculator/estimation logic belongs to Phase 2B per roadmap. **Format naming:** Product identifiers **BASIC**, **PRO**, **EXCLUSIVE** are used in the Parcours visibility-estimation block (untranslated); localized placement descriptions in parentheses (e.g. FR: arrière, latéral, habillage complet). Offres cards may use format labels per current implementation.
- **Parcours section:** Must remain a schematic route credibility block (timeline, route points, line). **Left column:** Route timeline with **live progress visualization** — markers and segments use three states: **ACTIVE** (current point), **FILLED** (path already covered in current direction), **MUTED** (not yet covered). On forward motion (Montpellier → La Grande-Motte) the path fills progressively top to bottom; on backward motion it fades progressively bottom to top. This is **not** visited-history logic; it is live ping-pong route visualization. **Mobile layout:** Route module is a compact centered block on mobile (`w-fit` inner container, `md:w-full md:max-w-xs` on desktop); marker column left, labels right (single-row layout); do not center text under markers. **Right column:** **Semi-static** — only the **location title** and **short description** are dynamic per active route point; the **three bullets** (Car / Repeat / MapPin) and the **small note** are **static** shared content across all locations (advertising logic: visibility in daily flows, repeated message exposure, presence in traffic and while parked). Parcours content must focus on advertising exposure; avoid tourism or architecture language. Do not turn it into a map or add map tiles, map APIs, or map providers unless the roadmap phase allows it. **Visibility block** (inside Parcours): title e.g. “Estimation de la visibilité”; examples use **BASIC / PRO / EXCLUSIVE** with localized placement in parentheses.
- **Contact form:** Must remain visual-only. Use `onSubmit={(e) => e.preventDefault()}`. No async submit, no backend-oriented validation, no API or server action submission.
- **Mobile bottom nav and floating actions:** Are part of the current UI architecture. **Floating actions include only scroll-to-top** (no floating contact button). On mobile, bottom nav is the primary navigation; scroll-to-top appears above it after scroll threshold. **MobileBottomNav** must use a **mounted guard** to avoid hydration mismatch: initial render uses neutral state (no active item); active-section highlighting (hash + scroll) runs only after client mount via `useEffect`. Nav surface: **bg-white/80** and **dark:bg-slate-900/80** for slight transparency; blur and rounded shape preserved.
- **Reduced motion:** Support must be preserved. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; disable or simplify non-essential animations when set (hero rotator, Parcours autoplay, section entrances).
- **Focus only on:** layout, styling, responsiveness, and animations when editing. Use Tailwind and Framer Motion for subtle, professional motion.
- **Imagery:** Prefer real vehicle imagery in Hero and Offres when assets exist. Route/coverage in Parcours must stay schematic; no real map integration until roadmap allows it.
- **Localization:** **FR-first, section-based architecture.** Translations live under `src/i18n/` with locales `fr`, `en`, `ua`; each locale is split into section files (common, hero, support, parcours, offres, contact). **FR is the canonical source;** EN and UA must match FR structure exactly. **Runtime:** custom LanguageContext (no next-intl/react-i18next); whole-locale fallback only (no key-by-key fallback). TranslationKeys are derived from FR. Proper nouns (place names) must use curated translations per locale; see DESIGN_SYSTEM.md. Do not rely on automatic translation for Montpellier, Port Marianne, Carnon, Palavas, La Grande-Motte (and UA equivalents: Монпельє, Порт-Маріанн, Карнон, Палавас, Ла-Гранд-Мотт).

## Behaviour

- Use SPEC as the single source of truth for product, business and roadmap.
- When in doubt, prefer SPEC content over assumptions.
- New features or copy changes should align with PRODUCT and BUSINESS docs; if they don't, update SPEC first (or propose an update) before implementing.
