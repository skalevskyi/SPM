# SPM — Project Roadmap

## Current Status

- **Current phase:** Skalevskyi publicite mobile (SPM) — Phase 2A — UI / Visual MVP
- **Next focus:** Minor polish, final QA, optional branding refinement as needed. No new section scope in 2A.

---

## Phase 1 — Concept

- ✓ concept defined
- ✓ pricing estimation model (no fixed prices; see pricing_model.md)
- ✓ visibility methodology (indicative placeholders; see visibility_model.md)
- ✓ landing wireframe

## Phase 2A — UI / Visual MVP

- ✓ Navbar (desktop: brand, Process / Fonctionnement / Як працює, Parcours / Route, Offres / Offers, Contact / Контакт; language/theme)
- ✓ Hero (real imagery, premium rotator, reduced motion support)
- ✓ **Process / Fonctionnement / Як працює** section (id #support; UI titles per locale; concise 4-step explanatory flow; no route/format breakdown; no package numbers/pricing)
- ✓ Parcours section (route credibility block; id #parcours; schematic timeline with **live progress visualization** — ACTIVE/FILLED/MUTED; **semi-static right column**: dynamic location title + description + compact icon/tag row; **three bullets are semi-dynamic** by active route point; previously repeated note under bullets is not shown; subtle timeline hint under the route module; calmer autoplay interval; visibility block **BASIC / PRO / EXCLUSIVE** with localized placement; no map)
- ✓ Offres section (three packages; real mockups; **no fixed prices in UI**; “Calculer” expands calculator **placeholder** only)
- ✓ Calculator placeholder UI inside Offres cards (expandable shell, static fields, CTA to #contact; no real logic)
- ✓ Contact section (visual-only form; id #contact)
- ✓ Footer (compact premium footer with brand/positioning; no duplicated navigation links)
- ✓ Mobile bottom navigation (Process / Fonctionnement / Як працює, Parcours / Route, Offres / Offers / Пропозиції, Contact / Контакт)
- ✓ **Floating actions: scroll-to-top only** (no floating contact button)
- ✓ Reduced motion support (hero, Parcours, section entrances)
- ✓ Responsive layout; main bottom padding for mobile nav
- ✓ Favicon / app icon metadata; brand asset integration
- ✓ Localization: **FR-first, section-based** under `src/i18n/locales/{fr,en,ua}`; custom LanguageContext; whole-locale fallback; TranslationKeys from FR; curated place names (FR/EN/UA); Manrope typography; UTF-8 clean
- ✓ Mobile navigation hydration stability fix (mounted guard; no SSR/client active-state mismatch)
- ✓ UA typography stability on mobile (Manrope Cyrillic subset to prevent font fallback)
- ✓ Support section rendering consistency (locale switching does not leave animated steps hidden/partial)
- ✓ Mobile hero vertical rhythm tuning (reduced perceived drift for long UA copy)
- ✓ Mobile bottom nav active shell parity (clearer visual shell without layout shift)
- ✓ Mobile bottom nav discrete active switching (no shared sliding transfer between items)
